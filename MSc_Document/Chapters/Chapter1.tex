Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has seen substantial advancements in recent years, transforming the process of data extraction from visual mediums to digital formats. This technology, crucial in numerous fields ranging from document digitization to automated data entry systems. OCR holds specific importance when it comes to interpreting sensor readings, a key aspect of data-driven industries. The necessity for accurate, efficient, and automated reading of sensor-generated data has led to the investigation of various techniques and models within the OCR domain.

Two models which feature prominently emerged as potential solutions, namely Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine sponsored by Google, and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), a combination of CNN, RNN, and Connectionist Temporal Classification that offers promising results in scene text recognition tasks.

In OCR applications, image preprocessing has a pivotal role. It prepares an image for further processing by reducing noise and unnecessary details and enhancing features that are important for later stages, thereby directly influencing the accuracy of the final output. Among various preprocessing techniques, the novel approach of red and green color masking, followed by conversion to grayscale, has shown to significantly improve the accuracy of digit recognition.




\section{Motivation}


The motivation behind this research stems from the challenges encountered in the manual and infrequent readings of environmental sensors in various operational settings such as factories. These sensors, while accurate and essential, lack a means for continuous data capture. Typically, an individual manually reads the sensor outputs at fixed intervals, which could range from hourly to daily. This method, while necessary, is prone to human error, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the recorded data and subsequent analysis reports. Furthermore, the infrequency of readings may result in delays in responding to critical sensor data, which could precipitate further issues. These complications could be mitigated with the implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. By enabling continuous, automated readings of these sensors, OCR has the potential to not only reduce errors but also ensure timely reaction to important sensor changes, optimizing the overall operation and efficiency of the systems.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
The primary aim of this research is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images of sensor readings by applying novel preprocessing steps and optimizing image capture settings. This project focuses on two OCR methods: Tesseract OCR and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) models, both widely used for text recognition tasks.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Objective 1: Assess the Performance of Tesseract OCR and CRNN Models}\\
          The initial phase of the project involves a baseline assessment of the existing OCR systems. The Tesseract OCR and CRNN models will be employed on multiple sets of image files, with each set undergoing a 'global run'. This step aims to establish a baseline for the performance of these systems without any preprocessing measures.

    \item \textbf{Objective 2: Design and Implement Image Preprocessing Techniques}\\
          In an attempt to enhance the quality of the images and subsequently improve the OCR results, various image preprocessing methods will be introduced. A primary focus will be the implementation of color masking (specifically for green and red) prior to the conversion to grayscale. This approach aims to make the images clearer and more conducive to OCR.

    \item \textbf{Objective 3: Identify Optimal Image Capture Settings}\\
          In parallel with image preprocessing, the research will aim to identify the optimal parameters for image capture to further enhance OCR performance. The specific parameters of focus will include camera contrast, distance, and lighting.

    \item \textbf{Objective 4: Compare and Evaluate the Effects of Preprocessing and Optimized Capture Settings on OCR Results}\\
          Once preprocessing measures and optimized image capture settings have been implemented, the images will undergo OCR using both Tesseract and CRNN models. This step aims to ascertain the joint impact of preprocessing and optimal capture parameters on the performance of OCR systems.

    \item \textbf{Objective 5: Analyze and Report Findings}\\
          The final objective of the research is to analyze the findings and draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing techniques and optimal capture parameters. This analysis aims to fill a gap in the literature, which currently lacks comprehensive studies on the potential benefits of image preprocessing and capture settings optimization for OCR of sensor readings.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, this research seeks not only to enhance our understanding of how image preprocessing and capture optimization can improve OCR outcomes, but also to provide practical insights that could inform the future development of OCR systems.
