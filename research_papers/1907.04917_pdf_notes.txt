Summary

This paper describes a novel approach to OCR using image recognition based classification for ancient Tamil inscriptions in temples. The proposed work focuses on improving optical character recognition techniques for ancient Tamil script which was in use between the 7th and 12th centuries. A data set has been curated using cropped images of characters found on certain temple inscriptions, specific to this time period as a case study. After using Otsu thresholding method for binarization of the image, a two-dimensional convolution neural network is defined and used to train, classify, and recognize the ancient Tamil characters. To implement the optical character recognition techniques, the neural network is linked to the Tesseract using the Pytesseract library in Python. As an added feature, this work also incorporates Google’s text to speech voice engine to produce an audio output of the digitized text. Various samples for both modern and ancient Tamil were collected and passed through the system. It is found that for Tamil inscriptions studied over the considered time period, a combined efficiency (OCR and text to speech) of 77.7% can be achieved.

How does the article contribute to the field?

The article "A Novel Approach to OCR using Image Recognition based Classification for Ancient Tamil Inscriptions in Temples" proposes a new approach to improve optical character recognition techniques for ancient Tamil script which was in use between the 7th and 12th centuries. The article curates a functional data set for ancient Tamil characters using cropped images of characters found on certain temple inscriptions, specific to this time period as a case study. The article then uses a two-dimensional convolution neural network to train, classify, and recognize the ancient Tamil characters. The article also incorporates Google’s text to speech voice engine to produce an audio output of the digitized text. The article concludes that for Tamil inscriptions studied over the considered time period, a combined efficiency (OCR and text to speech) of 77.7% can be achieved ¹.

Techniques

The author used **Otsu thresholding method** for binarization of the image and a **two-dimensional convolution neural network** to train, classify, and recognize the ancient Tamil characters. To implement the optical character recognition techniques, the neural network is linked to the Tesseract using the Pytesseract library in Python. As an added feature, this work also incorporates Google’s text to speech voice engine to produce an audio output of the digitized text.
